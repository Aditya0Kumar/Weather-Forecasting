            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Weather simply refers to the condition of air on the earth at a given place and time. 
            It is a continuous, dataintensive, multidimensional, dynamic and chaotic process. 
            These properties make weather forecasting is a
            formidable challenge. Forecasting is the process of estimation in unknown situations from the historical data.
            Weather forecasting is one of the most scientifically and technologically challenging problems around the world
            in the last century. To make an accurate prediction is indeed, one of the major challenges that meteorologists
            are facing all over the world. Since ancient times, weather prediction has been one of the most interesting and
            fascinating domains. Scientists have tried to forecast meteorological characteristics using a number of methods,
            some of these methods being more accurate than others.</p>
            <p>Weather forecasting entails predicting how the present state of the atmosphere will change. Present weather
            conditions are obtained by ground observations, observations from ships, observation from aircraft, radio
            sounds, doppler radar and satellites. This information is sent to meteorological centers where the data are
            collected, analyzed and made into a variety of charts, maps and graphs. Modern high-speed computers transfer
            the many thousands of observations onto surface and upper-air maps. Weather forecasts provide critical
            information about future weather.</p>
            <p>
            Forecasting has pulled in the consideration of numerous
            researchers due to its impact on the health of humans. The
            availability of large-scale forecasting data and the origin of
            computer information and technology over the past decade
            have encouraged researchers to explore mysterious patterns
            in large-scale weather forecasting databases. Forecasting of
            Weather is a research project with a wide range of potential
            applications from air travel to agriculture and tourism.
            Forecasting is a complex and challenging skill that involves
            observing and processing a large amount of data.</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, many important efforts to predict the
            weather using mathematical modeling techniques including
            machine learning, deep learning, data mining have been
            done. Methods include persistence, weather, viewing the sky,
            barometer use, nowcasting, use of predictive models, analog
            and predict together. Predictability can be used by air traffic,
            weather warnings, maritime, agricultural, utility companies,
            private sector, military. Forecasting is a scientific challenge
            based on good weather monitoring, data analysis by
            meteorologists and computers, and a fast communication
            system.</p>
            <p>Weather forecasting is done using relevant details about the
            present status of the atmosphere and utilizing a scientific
            understanding of the cosmic technique to show how the universe
            will change in the next few hours.</p>

            <p><img src="image/rainimg2.png"></p>
            <p>Weather forecasting is indeed a major application of science and technology. With the help of advanced tools
            and techniques, scientists and meteorologists can predict the weather accurately and provide information to
            the public, which can be used to make informed decisions related to travel, agriculture, construction, and many
            other activities. Machine learning algorithms are also used to analyze large amounts of data and identify
            patterns, which can be used to make more accurate predictions.
            This system provides the Average weather of the current day and also provides the weather prediction for
            there upcoming four days as well as information about UV index, wind cloud cover, and Humidity. The model is
            beneficial for the citizens of the specific area Because this model pro information about a specific area. In this
            model we will gather information from various platforms And data gathering is indeed a crucial task in weather
            forecasting.</p><p>
            Accurate and timely weather forecasts rely heavily on the availability of high-quality data. Without reliable
            data, It would be difficult for meteorologists to accurately predict the weather. The ultimate goal of the system
            is to create a reliable and accurate weather prediction model.
            </p><p>
            There are many different end-to-end user predictions. Weather
            alerts are important predictions because they are used for the
            protection of health and property. Predictions based on
            temperature and rainfall are important in agriculture, and
            therefore in order traders within the stock market. Temperature
            forecasts are also used by companies to measure more demand
            days to come. Every day people use the weather forecast to find
            out what to wear on a given day.
            </p><br>
            Forecast of future weather is one of the dominant concerns in
            today’s era. Several techniques that have been used to
            forecast future weather are statistical analysis, machine
            learning, and deep learning techniques. Forecast of weather
            can assist in the decision-making process for the prevention
            of disasters. While forecasting weekly weather can help
            people, decide and manage their activities and recreational
            programs it can also help Smart management programs. The
            accuracy of the Short term ambient forecast conditions is
            particularly conducive to the development of forecast
            management strategies. This paper presents an inclusive
            survey on such methods based on Machine Learning, and
            Deep Learning Techniques used to predict weather and
            discusses the applications, types, and problems of the
            forecasting
            <br><br><h1>MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES USED IN
            WEATHER FORECASTING</h1>
            So far, anything we have seen is traditional weather forecasts.
            These methods are not stable and tend to make mistakes in
            finding. In addition, we cannot predict big time to use them
            because they become inaccurate at the time. The Most commonly
            utilized machine learning techniques for weather forecasting are
            Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Networks, Rule-based
            Methods, Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Belief Network, KNearest Neighbor, Random Forest Algorithm, Linear Regression.
            There are usually only two machine learning methods used to
            predict the weather i.e. Bayesian Network and Neural Network.
            <br><br><h2>NEURAL NETWORK</h2>
            Neural Networks are extremely amazing in nature so it is
            the most famous approach to contemplate weather
            forecasting equipment. The primary justification for this
            notoriety is the capacity to catch non-linear conditions of the
            past and future weather conditions, in contrast to the reversal
            of the line and models of active order.
            <br><br><h2>BAYESIAN NETWORK</h2>
            Bayesian Network utilizes machine learning algorithms to
            decide the right Bayesian Network and boundaries
            [temperature, stickiness, see, etc.]. The expense of the
            Bayesian Network computation is extravagant because of an
            enormous number of various conditions.
            <br><br><br><br><h1>MACHINE LEARNING SEQUENCE IN DATA
            MINING TECHNIQUES</h1>
            <br><br><h2>DATA COLLECTION</h2>
            The information utilized was gathered at the
            meteorologist’s center. The accompanying advances were
            adopted in this exploration stage: Data Cleaning, Data
            Selection, Data Transformation, and Data Mining.

            <br><br><h2>DATA CLEANING</h2>
            At this stage, the corresponding data model format
            was created which is to look for missing information,
            recover information, and erase awful information.
            Eventually, the system cleanup details were converted
            into the appropriate data mining format.
            <br><br> <h2>DATA SELECTION</h2>
            Data relating to analysis as a decision tree was cut and
            extracted from the database.
            <br><br> <h2>DATA TRANSFORMATION</h2>
            “This is also known as data consolidation”. It is the
            stage wherein the picked data is changed into structures
            appropriate for Data mining. The data file was saved in
            Commas Separated Value (CVS) document format and
            the dataset was normalized to diminish the effect of
            scaling on the data.
            <br><br><h2>DATA MINING STAGE</h2>
            The data mining phase is separated into three stages.
            In each stage, all algorithms are utilized to analyze the
            climate data set. The test method adopted in this study is
            to divide the train training percentage into the data
            percentage, cross it working on it and test the leftover
            rates. From there on the revelation of interesting patterns
            represent information.
            <br><br><br><h1>DATA MINING TECHNIQUES USED IN
            WEATHER FORECASTING</h1>
            The way toward getting fascinating information from a
            gigantic data known as Data Mining. Data sources are
            databases, data warehouses, the web, and other information
            repositories. Furthermore, it is iterative sequence data. The
            most utilized Data mining procedure are classification,
            clustering, Decision Trees.
            <br><br> <h2>CLASSIFICATION</h2>
            Classification means tracking down a model that
            classifies data classes for having the option to utilize a
            model to foresee the class of objects with their unknown
            class label. Different classification algorithms are
            Backpropagation, KNN and, genetic algorithm.
            <br><br><h2>CLUSTERING</h2>
            Clustering investigations data objects without contact
            with a notable category label. The unsupervised learning
            method of the clustering process is a helpful method to
            discover styles and patterns in data, where there are no
            pre-defined classes. Some of the clustering
            algorithms are K- mean and k- media.
            <br><br><h2>DECISION TREE</h2>
            Structural structures such as trees representing decision
            sets. These decisions generate data classification rules.
            <br><br><h2>DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR WEATHER
            FORECASTING</h2>
            Up until this point, anything we have seen is known as
            conventional weather forecasts. These conventional techniques
            are flimsy and often make prediction mistakes. Moreover, we
            cannot predict a great time to use them because they become
            inaccurate at the time. There are usually some deep learning
            methods used to predict the weather i.e. Convolution Network
            (CN), Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBM),
            Recurrent Neural Network.
            <br><br><h2>RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK</h2>
            Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is an artificial NN used to anticipate a progression of times. Elman
            networks that are important for the RNN comprising of at
            least one secret layer. The primary layer has the weight found
            in the installation all the layers will get the load from the
            previous layer. This network has the function of activating
            which can be in the form of any function going on and on.
            Postpones that happened in the primary secret layer
            previously (t-l) can be applied to the present (t). In contrast to
            the repetitive neural network is a feedback loop that conveys
            the details of the interruption (sound) of the previous input to
            be inserted into the next input.
            <br><br><h2>CONDITIONAL RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN
            MACHINES (CRBM)</h2>
            Restricted Boltzmann Machines are deep learning models
            to tackle different issues, for example, collaborative filtering,
            classification, and modelling motion capture data problems.
            <br><br><h2>CONVOLUTION NETWORK (CN)</h2>
            Convolutional network (CN) models , as well as
            neocognitrons, known as one of the biologically
            inspired models.
            LeCunet al. describes the deep CN structure can have
            several stages. For CN application we use color images as
            input, the CN commonly used in the background on the
            feature map can be a 2D list containing the color path of the
            input image (for audio input map for each feature could be an
            ID list, and for a video or a volumetric image, it could be a
            3D list.
            The common unsupervised training method for CNN to
            learn the filter coefficients in the filter bank layers is called
            Predictive Sparse Decomposition Algorithm.

            <br><br><h2>PROBLEMS OF WEATHER FORECASTING</h2>
            An objective of all scientific endeavors is to make exact
            forecasts. Physicists or chemists conducting laboratory tests
            do so in the desire for tracking down some fundamental rules
            that can be utilized to foresee the result of different tests
            dependent on those standards. Indeed, most laws of science
            are too precise expectations in regards to the result of
            particular sorts of tests. In any case, hardly a few
            physiologists are more worried about more complex or
            challenging predictors than a meteorologist.
            <br><br<h2>INCOMPLETE DATA</h2>
            Data for modern numerical models still contributes
            significantly to radiosonde imaging. However, the
            numerous radio broadcasts the World over has declined
            in the course of recent many years. The most evolved
            nations on the planet today, go through more cash to
            dispatch satellites than exhausting weather balloons.
            Satellite information is internationally normal, yet
            information coordination specialists are as yet
            attempting to sort out how this information can be”
            appropriately processed” by models. In addition,
            important climatic factors remain elusive, especially at
            sea. Model results are as good as the data in its original
            form.
            <br><br><h2>MISCONCEPTIONS “VISION” AND
            “FUTURES”</h2>
            Today’s forecasts include the inevitable trade between
            horizontal and long-term resolutions. This is because
            good adjustment means more points than can be
            calculated. This requires a lot of computer time. The
            future forecast also requires counting millions or
            billions. When optimized with a long-range forecast, this
            task can squeeze the fastest supercomputers today. One
            would not get predictions for weeks. Future
            improvements to computers will help speed things up.
            So far, however, some species have not been able to
            select or “see” such small objects as clouds, raindrops,
            and snowflakes. To compensate for this complex “idea”
            of models, the computer code incorporates unlimited
            limitations into the unseen. These are called
            parameterizations. Even though science is deeply rooted
            in them, this approach does not come close to
            discovering the complex truth of the matter. This is
            because; the events of the smallest scale are often very
            frightening to understand.
            Therefore, it is not an insult to the skills of astronomers
            to say that the performance of parameters is the
            “backbone” of reality.
            <br><br><h2>CONFLICT</h2>
            It is shocking to realize that, even if a large computer
            with 4,000 statistics per second were not established, no
            better predictable results would be obtained. The weather
            forecast for the best solution has its limitations.
            The reason for these limitations is the ambitious asset of
            complex systems, which change like air. It is called
            “Empathy dependence on original conditions”, and is a
            symbol of what is widely known as revolutionary theory.
            Space disorder doesn’t imply that everything is demolished;
            all things being equal, it implies that the climate, in actuality,
            and the computer model can gain uniquely in contrast to the
            primary marginally various conditions.
            <br><br><br><br><h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
            Weather forecasting estimating is the usage of science and
            development to anticipate the states of the environment for a
            given area and time. Peoples have attempted to anticipate the
            climate casually for a significant long time and officially since the
            nineteenth century. Climate guesses are made by social occasion
            quantitative data about the current status of the environment at a
            given spot and utilizing meteorology to project how the climate
            will change.
            With scientific advancements, a lot of research is going on
            weather gauging utilizing Data mining, deep learning, machine
            learning have been done. However, there was a lack of surveys
            available on the present status of exploration and application. This
            paper thus offers a survey of weather forecasting using various
            techniques. Also summarizing the key concepts and focusing on
            the existing work on weather forecasting, its types, and its
            applications. To conclude, how deep learning, data mining, and
            machine learning algorithms were employed in weather
            forecasting is exceptionally important to guarantee future
            exploration will focus destined for success, accordingly
            improving the performance of weather predictions.
