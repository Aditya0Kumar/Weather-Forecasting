            <h1>Types of Weather Forecasting</h1><br><p>
            <br>A daily weather forecast involves the work of thousands of observers and meteorologists all over the world. Modern computers make forecasts more accurate than ever, and weather satellites orbiting the earth take photographs of clouds from space. 
            <br>Generally, there are two methods used in weather forecasting namely the empirical and dynamical approach.<br>The empirical approach is based upon the occurrence of analogues and is often referred to by meteorologists as analogue forecasting. This approach normally is useful for predicting local-scale weather if recorded cases are plentiful.<br> Dynamical approach is based upon equation and forward ns of the atmosphere and is often referred to as computer modeling. This dynamical approach is useful for modeling large-scale weather phenomena and may not term weather efficiently.<br> Most of the weather forecasting systems combine rical and dynamical approaches.
            <br>Forecasters use the observations from ground and space, along with formulas and rules based on experience of what has happened in the past, and then make their forecast.
            <br>Meteorologists actually use a combination of several different methods to come up with their daily weather forecasts. They are
            <i><br>a) Persistence Forecasting
            <br>b) Synoptic Forecasting
            <br>c) Statistical Forecasting
            <br>d) Computer forecasting</i><br>
            <br><i><b>a) Persistence Forecasting</b></i>
            <br>The simplest method of forecasting the weather is persistence forecasting. It relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts. This assumes that what the weather is doing now is what it will continue to do. To find out what the weather is doing, meteorologists make weather observations.
            <br>
            <br><i><b>b) Synoptic Forecasting</b></i>
            <br>This method uses the basic rules for forecasting. Meteorologists take their observations, and apply those rules to make a short-term forecast.
            <br>
            <br><i><b>c) Statistical Forecasting</b></i>
            <br>Meteorologists ask themselves, what does it usually do this time of the year? Records of average temperatures, average rainfall and average snowfall over the years give forecasters an idea of what the weather is "supposed to be like" at a certain time of the year.
            <br>
            <br><i><b>d) Computer forecasting</b></i>
            <br>Forecasters take their observations and plug the numbers into complicated equations. Several ultra-high-speed computers run these various equations to make computer "models" which give a forecast for the next several days. Often, different equations produce different results, so meteorologists must always use the other forecasting methods along with this one.
            <br>
            <br>Using all the above methods, forecasters come up with their "best guess" as to what weather conditions will be over the next few days.
            <br>Weather forecasting now has a wide range of operational products that traditionally are classified under the following groups:
                <i><br>Very short-range forecast<br>
                Short-range forecast<br>
                Medium-range forecast<br>
                Long-range forecast<br></i><br>
            <i><b>Short Range Forecasting:</b></i> This forecasting will last 1-2 days.
            The weather has an immense influence on human daily patterns, the production of food, and personal comfort zones. 
            
            Forecasting plays an important role in planning current and future activities. So, there are other aspects that may have a huge impact on the forecasting outcome. 
            
            However, accurate forecasting is very crucial. Forecasting is an important tool for various analyses. ECMWF is the most precise global model. ECMWF performs way better than the GFS. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <i><b>Medium Range Forecasting:</b></i> This kind of forecasting lasts 3-4 days to 2 weeks. Medium-term forecasts are made for small strategic resolutions in correlation with the nature of the business. They are very important in the area of business budgeting and development and it is from this forecast that company budgets are decided. inaccurate forecasting can have serious impacts on the rest of the organization, the organization will be forced to be with the unsold stock and will have to overspend on production again. A huge amount of money has to be paid to banks and creditors, and stock may have to be sold at a very less price. Organizations can go bankrupt due to insufficient attention on medium-term sales forecasting. The time period for a medium-term forecast is usually one year.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Long-Range Forecasts:</b></i> This forecasting is for times longer than four weeks. Long-term forecasts are for mainly major upcoming strategic decisions to be taken within an organization and for the organization, They focus very much on how to use resources in an optimum manner. They deal with basic items rather than specific items. And therefore, organizations are concerned more with general ongoing trends, following these trends, regular attempts to predict revenue-generating sales over periods greater than two years. In some strategies, For huge industries, accurate predictions might be needed for a decade or more to tackle the changes. The disadvantage of such forecasts is that they cannot be more than unclear. Prediction planners blame the forecast when things go wrong totally opposite what was predicted and forecasting hence receives criticism from all who are impacted.

            <h1><em>Methods Used to Find the Weather Forecasting</em></h1>
            <br>
            <p><i><b>Synoptic Method</b></i>:  A systematic study of recent weather forecasts from a wide area is used in this method of weather forecasting. Present weather conditions are linked to comparable scenarios in the past, and predictions are based on the premise that the current scenario would behave similarly to the analogous situation in the past.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Statistical Method</b></i>: Regression equations or other advanced relationships are formed between various weather elements and the subsequent climate in this method of weather forecasting. Predictions or weather criteria are usually chosen based on a potential physical interaction with the predictions.
            <br><br>
            <i><b>Numerical Weather Prediction Techniques</b></i>: Numerical weather prediction definition states that it forecasts weather using statistical models of the atmosphere and oceans dependent on current weather conditions. The action of the atmosphere is expressed in this system by a series of equations based on physical laws governing airflow, air pressure, and other data. The method has been shown to be optimal for medium-term forecasts.
            <br>Each weather forecast can be defined on the basis of the following criteria:
            <br>(a) Dominant technology
            <br>(b) Temporal range of validity after emission
            <br>(c) Characteristics of input and output time and space resolution
            <br>(d) Broadcasting needs
            <br>(e) Accuracy</p>
