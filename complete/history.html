            <h1><em>HISTORY</em></h1>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>In 650 BC, the Babylonians predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as astrology. In about 350 BC, Aristotle described weather patterns in Meteorologica. Later, Theophrastus compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the Book of Signs. Chinese weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300 BC, which was also around the same time ancient Indian astronomers developed weather-prediction methods. In New Testament times, Jesus himself referred to deciphering and understanding local weather patterns, by saying, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red', and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times."
<br>
<br>In 904 AD, Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture, translated into Arabic from an earlier Aramaic work, discussed the weather forecasting of atmospheric changes and signs from the planetary astral alterations; signs of rain based on observation of the lunar phases; and weather forecasts based on the movement of winds.
<br>
<br>Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it was observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore. However, not all of these predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.</p>
                <h2>Evolution of Weather Forecasting</h2>
                    <p>Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve. There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property.
                    In ancient times, forecasting was mostly based on weather pattern observation. Over the years, the study of weather patterns has resulted in various techniques for rainfall forecasting. Present rainfall forecasting embodies a combination of computer models, interpretation, and an acquaintance of weather patterns. The following technique was used for existing weather prediction.
                    <br><br><i><b>Use of a barometer</b></i>
                    Measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change in pressure, the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain.
                    <br><br><i><b>Looking at the sky</b></i>
                    Along with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the most important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is an indication of rain in the near future. At night, high thin clouds can lead to halos around the moon, which indicates the approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds which prevent fog formation.
                    <br><br><i><b>Nowcasting</b></i>
                    The forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as nowcasting. In this time range, it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human, given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours.
                    <br><br><i><b>Analog technique</b></i>
                    The analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall in places such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar technique is used in medium range forecasting, which is known as
                    teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime.
                    <br><br><i><b>Numerical Weather Prediction model</b></i>
                    Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is the science of predicting the weather using models of the atmosphere and computational techniques. Current weather conditions are used at the input of the mathematical models of the atmosphere to predict the weather. This model usually provides surrounding point around the wind farm with a spatial resolution of a few kilometers.NWP uses the power of computers to make a forecast. A forecaster examines how the features predicted by the computer will interact to produce the day's weather. The NWP method is flawed in that the equations used by the models to simulate the atmosphere are not precise.
                    A number of weather forecasting agencies operate modeling centers where supercomputers are used to run NWP models that span the entire globe. These include the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) in the United States, the United Kingdom Meteorological Office (UKMO), and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Although costly, a global approach to NWP is essential, especially for long-range forecasting. For this reason, achieving accurate forecasts requires an accurate analysis from which to get the model started. This involves a computer-based process called data assimilation, in which the most recent weather observations from around the world are combined with model forecasts to create a global analysis of current conditions. This becomes the starting point for the next run of the NWP model, and is the computer equivalent of the manual analysis cycle that forecasters carry out on an on-going basis. Global models play a key role in modern weather forecasting, and meteorologists at Met Service routinely use the NCEP, UKMO and ECMWF models to assist with day-to-day production of forecasts and weather warnings. These models give insight into the behavior of weather systems on a large scale, without much emphasis on local detail.
                    <br><br><i><b>Ensemble Forecasting</b></i>
                    To predict the weather forecast meteorologists have developed atmospheric models that approximate the atmosphere by using ensemble forecasting to describe how atmospheric temperature, pressure and moisture will change over time. The equations are programmed into a computer and the data on the present atmospheric conditions are fed into the computer. The computer solves the equations to determine how the different atmospheric variables will change over the next few minutes. The computer repeats this procedure again and again using the output from one cycle as the input for the next cycle. For some desired time in the future, the computer prints its calculated information. It then analyzes the data, drawing the lines for the projected position of the various pressure systems. A forecaster uses the prognostic chart as a guide to predicting the weather. There are many atmospheric models that represent the atmosphere, with each one interpreting the atmosphere in a slightly different way. Weather forecasts made for 12 and 24 hours are typically accurate. Forecasts made for two or three days are usually good. Beyond above five days, forecast accuracy falls off rapidly.
                    Weather information can also come from remote sensing, particularly radar and satellites.
                    <br><br><i><b>Radar</b></i>
                    Radar stands for Radio Detection and Ranging. In radar, a transmitter sends out radio waves. The radio waves bounce off the nearest object and then return to a receiver. Weather radar can sense many characteristics of precipitation, its location, motion, intensity, and the likelihood of future precipitation. Most weather radar is Doppler radar, which can also track how fast the precipitation falls. Radar can outline the structure of a storm and in doing so estimates the possibility that it will produce severe weather condition.
                    Weather satellites</b></i>
                    Weather satellites have been increasingly important sources of weather data sincethe first one was launched in 1952. Weather satellites are the best way to monitor large scale systems, like storms. Satellites can also monitor the spread of ash from a volcanic eruption, smoke from fires, and pollution. They are able to record long-term changes. Figure 1.1 shows one of the geostationary satellites that monitors conditions over the world. Weather satellites may observe all energy from all wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum. Most important are the visible light and infrared (heat)frequencies.
                    <br><br><i><b>Weather maps</b></i>
                    Weather maps simply and graphically depict meteorological conditions in the atmosphere. Weather maps may display only one feature of the atmosphere or multiple features. They can depict information from computer models or from human observations. Weather maps are found in newspapers, on television, and on the Internet.
                    On a weather map, each weather station will have important meteorological conditions plotted. These conditions may include temperature, current weather, dew point, cloud cover, sea level air pressure, wind speed and direction. On a weather map, meteorologists use many different symbols. These symbols give them a quick and easy
                    way to put information onto the map . Figure 1.2 shows some of these symbols used for Weather Map.</p>
