            <p>Weather simply refers to the condition of air on the earth at a given place and time.
                 It is a continuous, data-intensive, multidimensional, dynamic and chaotic process. 
                 These properties make weather forecasting is a formidable challenge. 
                 Forecasting is the process of estimation in unknown situations from the historical data. 
                 Weather forecasting is one of the most scientifically and technologically challenging 
                 problems around the world in the last century. To make an accurate prediction is indeed,
                  one of the major challenges that meteorologists are facing all over the world. 
                  Since ancient times, weather prediction has been one of the most interesting and fascinating
                domains. Scientists have tried to forecast meteorological characteristics using a number of
                 methods, some of these methods being more accurate than others</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>People have attempted to predict the weather for centuries. 
                        The Babylonians used cloud formations and astrology to forecast conditions in 650 BCE.
                         Aristotle's Meteorologica, written about 350 BCE, identified weather patterns. 
                         Theophrastus also compiled the Book of Signs, a book on weather forecasts. 
                         Weather prediction lore in China dates back to at least 300 BCE, around the same
                          period as ancient Indian astronomy developed weather-prediction methods. 
                          Observed cycles of events, also known as pattern recognition, 
                          is used in ancient weather forecasting methods. 
                          It has been noted, for example, that if the sunset was especially red, 
                          the next day was usually sunny. This knowledge was passed down over the years,
                           resulting in weather lore. However, not all of these forecasts are accurate, 
                           and many of them have been proved to be unreliable after being subjected to 
                           stringent statistical research...<a href="history.html">View More</a></p>

                    <p>Forecast of future weather is one of the dominant concerns in
                        today’s era. Several techniques that have been used to
                        forecast future weather are statistical analysis, machine
                        learning, and deep learning techniques. Forecast of weather
                        can assist in the decision-making process for the prevention
                        of disasters. While forecasting weekly weather can help
                        people, decide and manage their activities and recreational
                        programs it can also help Smart management programs. The
                        accuracy of the Short term ambient forecast conditions is
                        particularly conducive to the development of forecast
