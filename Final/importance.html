           <h1><em>IMPORTANCE OF WEATHER FORECASTING</em></h1>
               <p> Weather forecasting is used in many situations like severe weather alerts and advisories, predicting the behavior of the cloud for air transport, prediction of waterways in a sea, agricultural development and avoiding forest fire.</p>
               <p>
                There are various uses of weather forecasting in day-to-day life, it can be as simple as deciding whether to take an umbrella with you on your work or to deciding your outfit. Following are some of the places where weather forecasting plays a major role:</p>
                <h2><i>Climatology</i></h2>
                <p>Weather Forecasting is crucial since it helps to determine future climate changes. With the use of latitude, we can determine the probability of snow and hail reaching the surface. We are able to identify the thermal energy from the sun that is exposed to a region. Climatology is the scientific study of climates, which in simple words mean weather conditions over a period. A bunch of studies within atmospheric sciences also takes the help of the variables and averages of short-term and long-term weather conditions accumulated. Climatology is different from meteorology and can be divided into further areas of study. Different approaches to this segment can be taken. Currently, our primary research goal is to motivate and help the development of efficient and effective measures of Environmental activities.</p> 
            </p>
                <h2><i>Severe weather alerts and advisories</i></h2>
                <p>A major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories which are the national weather serviceâ€™s issue in anticipation of severe or hazardous weather are expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System which breaks into regular programming.
                </p>
                <h2><i>Predicting the behavior of the cloud for Air transport</i></h2>
                <p>The aviation industry is especially sensitive to the weather and accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircrafts because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, all of which can cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds.
                </p>
                <h2><i>Prediction of waterways in a sea</i></h2>
                <p>Commercial and recreational use of waterways can be limited significantly by wind direction, speed, wave periodicity, high tides and precipitation. These factors can each influence the safety of marine transit. Consequently, a variety of codes have been established to efficiently transmit detailed marine weather forecasts to vessel pilots via radio, for example marine forecast. Typical weather forecasts can be received at sea through the use of Radio fax.
                </p>
                <h2><i>Agricultural development</i></h2>
                <p>Seasons and nature play a major role in agriculture and farming. When it comes to the farming of various fruits, vegetables, and pulses, temperature is extremely important. Farmers didn't have a better understanding of weather forecasts before, so they had to rely on estimates to do their jobs. They do, however, sometimes suffer losses as a result of inaccurate weather forecasts. Farmers will now get all of their forecasts on their smartphones, thanks to advances in technology and the use of unique weather forecasting mechanisms. Of course, education in this area is critical, but the majority of the farmer community at this point understands the fundamentals, making it simple for them to use the features</p>
                <h2><i>Avoiding Forest fire</i></h2>
                <p>Weather forecasting of wind, precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling wildfires. Different indices, like the Forest fire weather indexand the Haines Index, have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can also be predicted by weather forecasting.
                </p>
                <h2><i>Military applications</i></h2>
                <p>Military weather forecasters present weather conditions to the war fighter community. Military weather forecasters provide pre-flight and in-flight weather briefs to pilots and provide real time resource protection services for military installations. Naval forecasters cover the waters and ship weather forecasts. The Navy provides a special service to both themselves and the rest of the federal government by issuing forecasts for tropical cyclone across the Pacific and Indian Oceans through their Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
                </p>
                <h2><i>Air Force</i></h2>
                <p>Air Force Weather provides weather forecasting for the Air Force and the Army. Air Force forecasters cover air operations in both wartime and peacetime operations and provide Army support. Military and civilian forecasters actively cooperate in analyzing and creating weather forecast products.</p>
